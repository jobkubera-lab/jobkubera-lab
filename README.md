## 👋 About me

I am **Nikola Kubera**, a **Technical Solutions Developer** building practical systems across AI, data, automation and digital products.

My work focuses on turning real operational problems into clear, testable tools. I use AI as part of the engineering workflow, but keep evidence, limitations and human control visible.

**Current flagship:** [KUBERA GEO SI](https://github.com/jobkubera-lab/kubera-geoai) — evidence-first property intelligence for UK estate agencies. [Live demo ↗](https://kubera-geoai.pages.dev)

**What I do hands-on:** Python and TypeScript applications · LLM tool-calling with server-side validation · open-data pipelines and geospatial products · automated tests and CI/CD · technical documentation.

**My role and AI-assisted development:** I define the problem, the architecture and the acceptance checks. AI tools help draft code; every change is reviewed, tested in CI and checked on the live system before it counts as done.

### 💡 How I work

| Principle | What it means in practice |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Evidence first** | Every figure, claim and recommendation carries its source, retrieval date and known limitations. If something has not been verified, it is labelled as such — never presented as fact. |
| **Human authority** | AI prepares, drafts and checks; people approve. Consequential actions — publishing, merging, sending, paying — pass through an explicit human decision. |
| **Practical engineering** | Systems are designed around a real user and a real workflow. Success is measured by whether the work gets done correctly, not by how impressive the AI looks. |
| **Verified delivery** | Every change goes through a branch, automated checks, review and a live verification after release. Problems found later are fixed openly, with the reason recorded. |
| **Lawful, open data** | Data is used only where the licence allows it. Official open datasets are preferred, and restricted sources are kept out of public products. |
| **Plain communication** | Results are explained in clear language for the people who use them — what was done, what is proven and what still needs a decision. |

## 🏠 Case study: KUBERA GEO SI

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Problem** | Estate agents in the UK spend time collecting the same facts for every home — past sales, energy rating, flood risk, local context — from many separate official sites. |
| **Users** | Estate agency staff preparing valuations, listings and buyer answers. |
| **Solution** | One map and home card that brings the official facts together, each with its source and date, plus an assistant that answers only from those checked sources. |
| **Technology** | React · TypeScript · Leaflet · Cloudflare Pages & Workers · GitHub Actions · UK open data (OGL) |
| **Quality** | Type checking, unit tests, assistant tests, a build-time guard against restricted data, deployment only after review and a live check |
| **Limits** | Pilot area Mitcham (CR4). Not a valuation tool. Homes for sale appear only from the agency's own listings. |

| **AI engineering** | LLM tool-calling · server-side validation · retrieval over verified sources · evaluation tests | Assistants that answer from checked data and say "not in our data" instead of guessing |
| **Quality & assurance** | Automated unit and integration tests · type checking · data validation · licence guards | Catching wrong figures, broken data and restricted content before release |
| **Delivery & operations** | Git · GitHub Actions (CI/CD) · Cloudflare Pages & Workers · Linux | Repeatable builds, automatic deployment after review, scheduled data refreshes |

## ⚡ From prototype to product

KUBERA separates **exploration** from **production**.

- **Exploration** — new ideas, interfaces and assistant behaviours are tested quickly in isolated prototypes. Speed matters here; nothing from this stage reaches users directly.
- **Production** — a capability is promoted into a product such as **KUBERA GEO SI** only after its data, behaviour and limits have been checked against real cases.

**Promotion criteria**

- the data source is identified, licensed for the intended use and dated;
- the behaviour is covered by automated tests, including failure and edge cases;
- limitations are written down and shown to the user where they matter;
- a person has reviewed the change before release, and the live result is checked after it.

A working prototype is treated as a hypothesis, not as proof.

| **02 · Investigate** | Available evidence, open data, licences, existing tools and alternatives | Source register and feasibility notes |
| **03 · Design** | Workflow, responsibilities, data model and clear limits of what the system will not do | Product structure and acceptance checks |
| **04 · Build** | Small, reviewable increments of software, data and AI components | Working feature behind automated checks |
| **05 · Verify** | Tests, live checks, review of evidence and honest reporting of weaknesses | Verified release and documented results |
| **06 · Operate & evolve** | Monitoring, scheduled data refreshes, user feedback and careful expansion | Maintained system with a clear change history |
